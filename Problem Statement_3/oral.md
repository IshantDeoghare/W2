Restaurant Menu Webpage Assignment
Objective

Design a restaurant menu webpage using HTML and CSS to display menu categories, dishes, and pricing.

Requirements

Include a header with the restaurant name ("ABC Delights - Restaurant Menu").
Add an introduction section with a welcome message, chef’s message, and food quality assurance.
List top dishes ranked by popularity (e.g., 1. Paneer Tikka, 2. Biryani).
Display available cuisines (e.g., Italian, Indian, Chinese).
Create a table with columns: Dish Name, Description, Price (INR ₹), and Dish Image.
Use suitable placeholder images for dishes.

Implementation Details
HTML Structure

Use a <header> for the restaurant title.
Create <section> elements for introduction, top dishes, cuisines, and menu.
Implement a <table> with <thead> and <tbody> to display dishes, including <img> tags for images.
Add a <footer> with copyright information.

CSS Styling

Set background-color: #f9f9f9 and font-family: Arial, sans-serif for the body.
Style the header with background-color: #4CAF50 and text-align: center.
Use max-width: 900px, margin: 20px auto, and box-shadow for sections.
Style the table with width: 100%, border-collapse: collapse, and responsive overflow-x: auto for screens ≤ 600px.
Ensure images in the table have max-width: 100px and vertical-align: middle.

Image Integration

Placeholder images are used (e.g., https://via.placeholder.com/100?text=Paneer+Tikka) and can be replaced with actual dish photos.
Images are embedded in table cells for each dish.
