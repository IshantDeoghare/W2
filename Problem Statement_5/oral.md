E-commerce Product Listing Webpage Assignment
Objective

Develop an e-commerce product listing page using Bootstrap, featuring a grid layout with Bootstrap cards for product display and category filters using Bootstrap's dropdown.
Ensure the page is fully responsive for different screen sizes.

Requirements

Include a header with a title ("Mug Store") and a brief description.
Implement category filters using Bootstrap dropdowns (e.g., Target Market, Print Area, Over Print, Product Exterior).
Display products in a grid layout using Bootstrap cards, including product name, brand, price, and size/color details.
Use placeholder images for products.
Ensure responsiveness across various screen sizes.

Implementation Details
HTML Structure

Use a <header> with a dark background and centered text for the title and description.
Implement a <nav> with a navbar containing dropdown menus for filters, utilizing Bootstrap's navbar and dropdown components.
Create a <div> with a row and col structure to display products as Bootstrap card components within a grid layout.
Include a select element for sorting by popularity.
Link Bootstrap CSS and JS from CDN for styling and functionality.

CSS Styling

Leverage Bootstrap's default grid system (row-cols-1 row-cols-md-2 row-cols-lg-3) for a responsive layout that adjusts from 1 column on small screens to 3 on large screens.
Use Bootstrap classes like bg-dark, text-white, py-3, my-4, and g-4 for spacing and styling.
Ensure cards maintain a consistent height (h-100) and include images (card-img-top), titles, and text details.

JavaScript

Bootstrap's JavaScript (bootstrap.bundle.min.js) handles dropdown functionality and navbar toggling for mobile responsiveness.
