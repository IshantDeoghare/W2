College Website Assignment
Objective

Create a responsive webpage for a college website using Bootstrap, featuring a top navbar and displaying year-wise toppers' data statistics in cards.

Requirements

Include a title ("Pune Institute of Computer Technology").
Implement a Bootstrap navbar with links: Home, About, Courses, Contact.
Add sections for welcome message, achievements, and year-wise toppers' statistics.
Use Bootstrap cards (col-md-4) to display toppers' details (Name, Department, Percentage, Photo) with a responsive grid layout (col-md-4, col-sm-6, col-12).
Ensure the navbar collapses into a toggle menu on mobile devices.
Include a footer with college address, contact details, and social media links.

Implementation Details
HTML Structure

Use a <nav> with navbar class for the top navigation bar, including a collapsible menu with Bootstrap's navbar-toggler.
Create a <header> for the title with a colored background.
Implement <section> elements for "Welcome to Pune ICT", "Our Achievements", and "Year-Wise Toppers".
Use a row with col classes to create a responsive card layout for toppers' data, each with an image and details.
Add a <footer> with address, contact info, and social media icons.

CSS Styling

Leverage Bootstrap classes like bg-dark, navbar-dark, bg-primary, text-white, py-5, and my-5 for styling and spacing.
Use row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-6 row-cols-md-4 g-4 for a responsive grid that adjusts from 1 column on small screens to 4 on medium/large screens.
Ensure cards maintain equal height (h-100) and center-aligned text with text-center.

JavaScript

Bootstrap's JavaScript (bootstrap.bundle.min.js) handles navbar toggling and responsiveness on mobile devices.
