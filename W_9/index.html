<!-- Questions and Answers
Q: What is the purpose of creating an index.html webpage using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap?
A: The purpose is to build a responsive and visually appealing personal webpage. HTML provides the structure, CSS adds custom styling, and Bootstrap enhances the design with pre-built components and a grid system, ensuring a professional look across devices.
Q: Why did you include multiple types of headings in your webpage?
A: I used headings (h1, h2, h3) to organize content hierarchically, with h1 for the main title, h2 for section titles, and h3 for subsections. This improves readability and helps search engines understand the page structure.
Q: How did you ensure the webpage is large enough (2-3 screens worth)?
A: I added multiple sections (Introduction, Education, Interests, Skills, More About Me) with paragraphs, lists, and a table. I included dummy content like additional paragraphs and line breaks to meet the 2-3 screen requirement when viewed on a standard monitor.
Q: What is the role of ordered and unordered lists in your webpage?
A: Ordered lists (<ol>) are used for my education timeline to show a sequence, while unordered lists (<ul>) list my interests without a specific order. Both enhance content organization and user navigation.
Q: How did you implement the table in your webpage?
A: I used a <table> element with Bootstrap’s table table-striped classes to display my skills and levels. The thead defines the header row, and tbody contains the data rows, making it clean and responsive.
Q: What are the purposes of line breaks (<br>) and horizontal lines (<hr>) in your design?
A: Line breaks (<br>) add spacing between elements for better readability, while horizontal lines (<hr>) visually separate sections, improving the page’s structure and user experience.
Q: Why did you add comments to the HTML file?
A: Comments () are included to explain sections or content (e.g., adding more content for size), making the code more maintainable and understandable for myself or other developers.
Q: How did you apply various text styles like bold, italic, strike-through, and underline?
A: I used <b> for bold, <i> for italic, <s> for strike-through, and <u> for underline within paragraphs to emphasize or decorate text, enhancing visual hierarchy and engagement.
Q: What are internal bookmarks, and how did you implement them?
A: Internal bookmarks allow navigation within the page. I used id attributes (e.g., id="intro") on div elements and linked them with href="#intro" in anchor tags, enabling direct jumps to sections via URLs like http://localhost/index.html#intro.
Q: How did you split the webpage into multiple HTML files?
A: I created separate files (education.html and interests.html) for detailed education and interests content. I added relative links (e.g., href="education.html") in index.html to connect them, ensuring seamless navigation.
Q: Why did you use relative links instead of absolute links?
A: Relative links (e.g., href="education.html") are used to ensure the links work when moving all files to a new directory. They are based on the file’s location relative to index.html, avoiding dependency on a specific server path.
Q: How did you embed images in your webpage?
A: I placed images in a sub-directory called images and embedded them using <img src="images/sample.jpg" alt="Sample Image" class="img-fluid">. The alt attribute provides accessibility, and img-fluid ensures responsiveness with Bootstrap.
Q: What changes did you make when moving styles to an external CSS file?
A: I moved inline styles (e.g., background-color, margin-bottom) from the <style> tag in index.html to a styles.css file. I then linked it with <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">, allowing reuse across multiple HTML files.
Q: How does Bootstrap enhance your webpage?
A: Bootstrap provides a responsive grid system, pre-styled components (e.g., table-striped), and utilities (e.g., container, img-fluid), reducing development time and ensuring the page adapts to different screen sizes effectively.
Q: What would you do to improve this webpage further?
A: I would add JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., form validation), optimize images for faster loading, include a navigation bar with Bootstrap’s navbar, and add more dynamic content like a blog section to enhance user engagement. -->
