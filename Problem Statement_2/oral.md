Objective

Develop a personal portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS to showcase personal details, skills, projects, educational details, and contact information.

Requirements

Include sections for personal details (e.g., email, phone, location), skills, projects, educational background, and contact information.
Add a profile image to enhance the visual appeal.
Ensure the webpage is styled with CSS for a clean and professional look.
Make the design responsive to different screen sizes.

Implementation Details
HTML Structure

Use a <header> for the profile image, name, and title.
Create separate <section> elements for personal details, skills, projects, education, and contact.
Include a <footer> with copyright information.
Add an <img> tag in the header with a placeholder or provided image URL.

CSS Styling

Apply inline CSS to the profile image with border-radius: 50%, width: 150px, height: 150px, object-fit: cover, and margin-bottom: 10px for a circular, properly sized, and centered appearance.
Use external CSS (styles.css) for overall layout, with properties like max-width: 800px, margin: 20px auto, and box-shadow for sections.
Ensure responsiveness with @media query for screens ≤ 600px, adjusting margins and padding.

Image Integration

The profile image is placed in the header, styled inline to be circular and 150x150 pixels.
The current image URL is a placeholder (https://imgs.search.brave.com/rGwzfO70pjbonM9GzCaTVw7qic45hRaPbQNucnLshk0/rs:fit:860:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4u/cGl4YWJheS5jb20v/cGhvdG8vMjAxNi8wMy8yNy8xNi81NC9m/YWNlLTEyODMxMDZf/NjQwLmpwZw), which can be replaced with a personal photo.
